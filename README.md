List of datasets of climate-derived energy variables

This is a work-in-progress list of all the free (non commercial) datasets of energy variables based on climate models, satellite, reanalyses.

The idea of sharing this list came after the [Next Generation Challenges in Energy-Climate Modelling](https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/weather-and-climate-at-reading/2020/keeping-the-lights-on-a-new-generation-of-research-into-climate-risks-in-energy-systems/) workshop and many people who attended the workshop helped me to fill the gaps. 

The list has also been posted on the [OpenMod forum](https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/t/freely-available-datasets-of-energy-variables/2291) and I will do my best to keep that one in sync.
